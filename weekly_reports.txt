10/9/17 - 10/15/17

  Team:
    a. Created an organizational structure (will be organized into a report that's due 10/19
    b. Set up a working environment - GitHub and Google Spreadsheets
    c. Decided on processors/accelerometer/transceiver/power delivery method

  Tapas:
    a. Explored methods of power delivery (zener voltage regulators/voltage divider/voltage regulator chip) and concluded that we will use buck converters because of their efficiency, and because they're cool
    b. Pushed team to decide on parts ADXL345 (accelerometer) and NRF24L01+ (transceivers) by determining which were optimal
    c. Assigned ARs to team for ownership of the blocks we are starting with.
    
  Yebin:
    a. Organized BOM and sort out which components to which vendors.
    b. Looked into chassis and motor driver ic. 


10/16/17 - 10/23/17

Team:
a. Worked on preliminary schematic using Eaglecad on 10/14/17
b. Parts are orderd (on 10/14/17) and arrived.
c. Decided not to use PIC on the receiver side and voltage regulators (L7805 and LM1115) to drop down 9V to 5V and 3.3V, respectively.
